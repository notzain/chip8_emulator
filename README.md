# Chip8

Chip8 is an interpreted programming language developed in the mid-1970's, for
the COSMAC VIP and TELMAC 1800 8-bit computers.

Chip8 programs ran on a Chip8 VM. This supposedly made creating videogames
easier.

Nowadays, the Chip8 is used as a learning device. The Chip8 is usually
recommended for programmers who are interested in creating their own
emulators. Chip8 is a good stepping stone to get into the world of emulating.
